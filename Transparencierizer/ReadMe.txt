Make sure you choose the opaque option and then click the make transparent button again, or else the window will stay unclickable and transparent!

I've added hot key support

Ctrl-O (Opaque) Changes the target window opaque
Ctrl-T (Transparent) Changes the target window transparent
Ctrl-U (program on top) Brings the transparencierizer to the top so you can change the settings
Ctrl-D (program normal) Makes the transparencierizer normal (not on top)

and fixed a bug, thanks NMMorrison for pointing it out.
It wouldn make windows pass mouse and keyboard input even if that option wasn't selected.
